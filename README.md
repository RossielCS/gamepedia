# gamepedia

> The objective of this repo is to build an app based on a "Catalogue of Recipes".<br />

The app is called "gamepedia" which displays a browsable list of videogames that the user can filter, access the details of each one, and can also search for games by title.<br />

The main requirements were:<br />
* The web app should have at least two types of pages:<br /> 
        a. One with a list of items that could be filtered by some parameters. <br />
        b. Another for the item details.<br />
* It should collect the data from an API from the React application.
